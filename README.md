# Global Vaccine Tracker Dashboard

## Project Description

The **Global Vaccine Tracker** is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to monitor and analyze the global COVID-19 vaccination efforts. It visualizes key vaccination-related metrics such as the percentage of the population vaccinated, participation in vaccination programs by country, and the correlation between a country's GDP and vaccination progress. This project helps stakeholders gain insights into vaccination trends across countries and continents, leveraging various visualizations such as bar charts, maps, and dual-axis charts. 

## Key Features and KPIs

1. **Vaccination Progress Overview**: 
   - Maximum number of people partially and fully vaccinated.
   - Percentage of people vaccinated over the total population.

2. **Country-wise Vaccination Participation**: 
   - Dual-axis bar chart showing the number of people partially and fully vaccinated across countries.

3. **Vaccination Distribution Map**:
   - A global map highlighting vaccination data across countries for a spatial understanding of global efforts.

4. **Vaccination vs. GDP Analysis**: 
   - Scatter plot showing the relationship between the GDP of each country and the number of people vaccinated.
   - A trend line to analyze the correlation between GDP and vaccination efforts.

5. **Filters for Enhanced Data Exploration**:
   - Interactive filters for country, continent, and date that apply across all visualizations for easy comparison and in-depth analysis.

6. **Dashboard**:
   - A consolidated view of all visualizations and KPIs to provide a comprehensive global vaccine tracker.
